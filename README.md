# hfetch
## my fetch (heavily inspired by jfetch)!
### what is it?
hfetch is a dead simple shell script that fetches your sysinfo and displays it cutely!
### how do you customise it?
you directly edit the source!
### how do you install it?
i'm thinking of adding it to aur or mpr or something, but for now drag the file into /usr/bin :3
## that's all! enjoy!
